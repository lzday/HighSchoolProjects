# HighSchoolProjects
Contains all the high school game programming projects that I worked on. Unfortunately, high school me did not have enough foresight to store my projects in a safe and easily accessible location, so I am now in the process of hunting down all the project files.

## Get the Ghost
This is a simple shooter type game, where the goal is to survive for as long as possible. Use the left and right arrow keys to move in their respective directions, and use the space bar to shoot upwards at the ghosts. The ghosts sometimes drop power-ups that can be used to better ensure survivability, but these buffs are removed as the player's life decreases.

This is the first game project I have ever worked on, meaning that the code and project files are completely destroyed. The only thing I managed to salvage was the .exe file.
