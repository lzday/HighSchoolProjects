# HighSchoolProjects
Contains the 3 high school game programming projects that I worked on. All of them were made in GameMaker using GML. Unfortunately, high school me did not have enough foresight to store my projects in a safe and easily accessible location, so I am now in the process of hunting down all the project files.

## Get the Ghost
This is a simple shooter type game, where the goal is to survive for as long as possible. Use the left and right arrow keys to move in the respective directions, and use the space bar to shoot upwards at the ghosts. The ghosts sometimes drop power-ups that can be used to better ensure survivability, but these buffs are removed as the player's life decreases.

Unfortunately, this is the first game project I have ever worked on, meaning that the code and project files are completely destroyed, save the .exe file that I managed to salvage.

## Maze Game
This is a 1v1 game where two players compete to be the first one to find their way through the maze and reach their destination. There are ghosts and monsters scattered throughout the maze, and the player must navigate around these obstacles to clear the game.

Since I have yet to recover the files, this description is completely based off of my memory of how the game is supposed to work.

## Escape Room
As the title suggests, this is an escape room based game, where the player must solve puzzles to find their way out of the room. The mechanics aren't very intuitive (16-year-old me was not a good puzzle designer), but I assure you that escaping is very much possible.
